NAME
 molior-deploy - info deployment type

DESCRIPTION
 The info plugin allows to create a zip file containing deployment information such as:
 - installed packages
 - debian security scan
 - modified files detected by debsums
 - package dependency graph
 - disk usage
 - changelogs and licenses


PARAMETERS
 The deployment configuration (deploy/*.conf file) recognizes the following variables:

 DEPLOYMENT_TYPE    Specify 'info' to use the info plugin
 INSTALL_PACKAGE    Specify package name to install (same as in the deployment this info package is meant for, or, preferrably use the -i option and use existing rootfs instead of package installation)
 ARCH               Specify the deployment architecture (if not amd64)


EXAMPLE

 deploy/info.conf:

   DEPLOYMENT_TYPE=info
   ARCH=armhf
   ORIG_DEPLOYMENT=installer-prod
   INSTALL_PACKAGE=toplevel-package
